### Business Cases

## 1. Traffic signal synchronization across multiple intersections.

This problem involves ranking streets or intersections based on traffic congestion to prioritize areas that need improvements. By analyzing congestion levels, cities can optimize traffic flow and allocate resources effectively to reduce congestion and improve commuting times.

We can use [Quick Sort](traffic_quick_sort.cpp) to address this problem, this algorithm takes in the congestion levels of different places and ranks them as per the traffic density, thus allowing the user to decide which place with that respective congestion level has to be prioritized.

### Key Benefits:

1. **Improved Traffic Flow**: Prioritizes congestion hotspots for better management.
2. **Reduced Commute Time**: Minimizes delays by optimizing traffic patterns.
3. **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Focuses efforts on the most congested areas.
4. **Environmental Impact**: Reduces emissions by easing traffic jams.
5. **Increased Safety**: Lowers accident risks by improving traffic management.
6. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Enables informed urban planning and quick responses.
